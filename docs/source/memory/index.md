# Memory

Memory systems enable agents to remember conversations, learn from interactions, and maintain context over time. Seashore provides three tiers of memory.

In this chapter:

- [Memory Tiers](./tiers.md) — Short-term, mid-term, and long-term memory
- [Using Memory](./usage.md) — Integrate memory with agents
- [Memory Consolidation](./consolidation.md) — Move memories between tiers
