# RAG

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines language models with knowledge retrieval. It lets you build AI systems that can answer questions using your own documents and data.

In this chapter:

- [Document Loading](./loading.md) — Load documents from various sources
- [Document Splitting](./splitting.md) — Split documents into chunks
- [Retrieval](./retrieval.md) — Search and retrieve relevant content
- [Complete RAG Pipeline](./pipeline.md) — Build end-to-end RAG systems
