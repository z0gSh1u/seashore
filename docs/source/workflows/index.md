# Workflows

Workflows let you build complex multi-step AI processes. Chain together LLM calls, tool executions, and custom logic into reusable pipelines.

In this chapter:

- [Basic Workflows](./basic.md) — Create simple sequential workflows
- [Node Types](./nodes.md) — LLM, tool, condition, parallel, and custom nodes
- [Control Flow](./control-flow.md) — Loops, branches, and complex patterns
- [Error Handling](./errors.md) — Retry strategies and fallbacks
